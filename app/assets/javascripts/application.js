// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files

// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.

// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details

//= require jquery
// As of Rails 5.1, jquery_ujs was replaced by rails-ujs, which does not
// depend on jQuery but can be used with applications that use jQuery. This
// application uses jQuery and we've chosen to use jquery_ujs instead of
// rails-ujs, mainly because it makes it easier to override $.rails.allowAction
// to replace JavaScript confirmation dialogs with application-specific modals.
